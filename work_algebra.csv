How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes"
"You have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?","We want $\\pi R^{2}-\\pi r^{2}\\leq 5\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\\leq 5$. Substituting 10 for $R+r$ gives $10(R-r)\\leq 5 \\implies R-r \\leq 1/2$. So the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$ and the point $(0, 2)$.","Completing the square, we get $f(x) = (x-4)^2 - 1$. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(4, -1)$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that the distance between $(0, 2)$ and $(4, -1)$ is $\\boxed{5}$"
What is the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20?,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\\cdot30\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\\%$ of 20 is $ 130\\cdot 20\\cdot\\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\\boxed{10}$"
What is the simplified numerical value of $\\frac{a+11b}{a-b}$ if $\\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$?,"Let's play with the given condition a little. Clearing out the denominator gives $4a+3b=5(a-2b)=5a-10b$. Selectively combine like terms by adding $9b-4a$ to both sides to get $12b=a-b$. This gives $\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1$.\n\nNow, we want to find $\\dfrac{a+11b}{a-b}$. Rewrite this as $\\dfrac{a-b+12b}{a-b}=\\dfrac{a-b}{a-b}+\\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1+1=\\boxed{2}$, and we are done"
"Find $A$ and $B$ such that\n\\[\\frac{4x}{x^2-8x+15} = \\frac{A}{x-3} + \\frac{B}{x-5}\\]for all $x$ besides 3 and 5. Express your answer as an ordered pair in the form $(A, B).$","Factoring the denominator on the left side gives \\[ \\frac{4x}{(x-5)(x-3)}=\\frac{A}{x-3}+\\frac{B}{x-5}. \\]Then, we multiply both sides of the equation by $(x - 3)(x - 5)$ to get \\[ 4x = A(x-5) + B(x-3). \\]If the linear expression $4x$ agrees with the linear expression $A(x-5) + B(x-3)$ at all values of $x$ besides 3 and 5, then the two expressions must agree for $x=3$ and $x=5$ as well.  Substituting $x = 3$, we get $12 = -2A$, so $A = -6$.  Likewise, we plug in $x = 5$ to solve for $B$. Substituting $x = 5$, we get $20 = 2B$, so $B = 10$.  Therefore, $(A, B) = \\boxed{(-6, 10)}.$"
