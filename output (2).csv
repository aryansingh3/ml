19,Q, A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? 
20,A, Let's think step by step. 
21,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
22,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

24,Q," Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? "
25,A, Let's think step by step. 
26,"The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. ",
27,"Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. ",

48,Q," Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? "
49,A, Let's think step by step. 
50,The cost of new tires is $180 per tire. ,
51,The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire. ,
52,The difference in cost is $180 - $40 = $140. ,
53,"To find the percent increase, we take the difference in cost and divide it by the original cost. In other words, we take $140 and divide it by $40. ",

320,A, Let's think step by step. 
321,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
322,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

621,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
622,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

624,Q," Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? "
625,A, Let's think step by step. 
626,"The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. ",
627,"Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. ",

1519,Q, A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? 
1520,A, Let's think step by step. 
1521,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
1522,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

1525,A, Let's think step by step. 
1526,"The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. ",
1527,"Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. ",

1819,Q, A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? 
1820,A, Let's think step by step. 
1821,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
1822,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

1824,Q," Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? "
1825,A, Let's think step by step. 
1826,"The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. ",
1827,"Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. ",

1841,A, Let's think step by step. 
1842,"There are 12 children to the left of Neha, so there must be at least 12 children in the row. ",
1843,"There are 6 children to the right of Radha, so there must be at least 18 children in the row. ",
1844,"There are 6 children between Radha and Neha, so there must be at least 24 children in the row. ",

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? "
1849,A, Let's think step by step. 
1850,The cost of new tires is $180 per tire. ,
1851,The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire. ,
1852,The difference in cost is $180 - $40 = $140. ,
1853,"To find the percent increase, we take the difference in cost and divide it by the original cost. In other words, we take $140 and divide it by $40. ",

2119,Q, A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? 
2120,A, Let's think step by step. 
2121,"First, we need to calculate the area of the paper. The paper is in a square form, so the area is just the length of one side squared. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2. ",
2122,"Next, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles. The area of a semi-circle is half the area of a circle, and the area of a circle is pi * r^2, where r is the radius. The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of one side",

2124,Q," Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? "
2125,A, Let's think step by step. 
2126,"The first thing we need to do is calculate the semi-annual interest rate. We do this by dividing the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year. In this case, we divide 12% by 2 to get 6%. ",
2127,"Next, we need to calculate the amount of interest that accrues each six months. We do this by multiplying the face value of the bond ($5,000) by the semi-annual interest rate (6%). This gives us $300. ",

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? "
2149,A, Let's think step by step. 
2150,The cost of new tires is $180 per tire. ,
2151,The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire. ,
2152,The difference in cost is $180 - $40 = $140. ,
2153,"To find the percent increase, we take the difference in cost and divide it by the original cost. In other words, we take $140 and divide it by $40. ",
